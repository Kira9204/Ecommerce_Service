# Ecommerce Service
------------
----------
A clean, modular and complete ecommerce service using REST APIs with JSON serialization.

The project contains everything you need to get going, including unit tests for the diffrent implementations provided and a MYSQL dump.

This project is an almost complete rewrite of an older Ecommerce service i wrote back in 2015 at C3L. The only thing left that could need some work is a better database design.

Although perfectly functional as far as i've tested, this serves more as a personal demonstration. Feel free to study it, but don't outright copy it.
